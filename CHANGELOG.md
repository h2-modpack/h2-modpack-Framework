# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Changed

- Hash/profile storage filtering now follows Lib's explicit `hash` storage axis instead of the old transient/runtime flags.
- Updated hash/profile ABI docs for direct alias-owned managed storage keys.
- Framework now treats Lib-injected `Enabled` storage as the module-level hash key while excluding `DebugMode` and non-hash storage from hash/profile output.
- Coordinators now register pack metadata through `Framework.registerCoordinator(...)` instead of calling Lib coordinator APIs directly.

## [1.1.0] - 2026-05-05

### Added

- Added a LuaLS public definition file at `src/def.lua` for the Framework module export, init contract, theme data, Quick Setup context, and pack runtime.
- Added `Framework.registerGui(packId)` as the supported GUI registration entrypoint for coordinator mods.
- Added `definition.hashGroupPlan` support through a dedicated hash-group builder for compact grouped hash/profile encoding.
- Added saved-profile auditing during framework initialization and from the Profiles tab.
- Added player-facing `THUNDERSTORE_README.md` packaging support.

### Changed

- `Framework.init(...)` now uses positional required arguments plus an optional `opts` table instead of nested `params.def`.
- Framework pack state now persists on `AdamantModpackFramework_Internal`, so repeated coordinator/framework reloads replace pack state without duplicating pack slots.
- Framework discovery now resolves modules through Lib's live-host registry instead of reading module public globals directly.
- UI and hash operations now snapshot current module hosts at operation start, so ordinary module behavior reloads can update through Lib-published hosts without rediscovery.
- Coordinated packs can rebuild when a coordinated module republishes a structurally changed host and Lib requests a coordinator rebuild.
- The main UI was split into focused runtime, profile, Quick Setup, module-tab, dev, and theme files.
- Profile/hash updates now flush on menu close instead of periodic HUD refreshes while the main UI is open.
- HUD fingerprint wrapping now uses Lib's reload-stable hook registration instead of raw ModUtil wrapping.
- HUD hash markers now use Lib's managed overlay stack instead of direct HUD component mutation.
- Framework UI now uses Lib's global UI overlay suppression gate, making configuration UI and gameplay overlays mutually exclusive on screen.
- Hash/profile serialization now escapes reserved token characters inside keys and values.
- Runtime-only storage aliases are rejected from hash groups so transient runtime markers cannot enter hash/profile output.
- Hash computation now rejects hashes from newer unsupported hash ABI versions instead of warning and continuing.
- `Hash.GetConfigHash(...)` now only supports the live pack state path; the unfinished profile-source argument was removed.
- The HUD hash marker can be suppressed with `opts.hideHashMarker` while keeping the coordinator UI active.
- Packaged README content moved out of `src/README.md`; package metadata now points at `THUNDERSTORE_README.md`.

### Fixed

- Fixed coordinated module startup lifecycle batching so `SetupRunData()` runs once after startup sync when needed.
- Fixed profile/hash apply failures to restore prior config/runtime state where possible.
- Fixed master pack and module batch toggles to roll back touched runtime state on failure.
- Fixed HUD refresh callback stacking across Framework reloads.
- Fixed stale UI state seams by routing Profiles, Quick Setup, and module tabs through explicit runtime/session flows.

### Documentation

- Rewrote coordinator docs around the supported bootstrap contract:
  - coordinator registration before `Framework.init(...)`
  - `Framework.registerGui(PACK_ID)` for GUI callback registration
  - positional `Framework.init(...)` arguments plus optional `opts`
  - Lib-host discovery and snapshot-host runtime behavior
- Expanded `HASH_PROFILE_ABI.md` with hash/profile invariants, token escaping, decode behavior, and shipped-module compatibility rules.
- Updated Quick Setup docs for coordinator-owned `opts.drawPackQuickContent(ctx)` and module-host quick content.
- Updated README and contributor docs to focus on the host-first coordinator/module contract.

### Tests

- Expanded Framework test coverage for discovery, hashing/profile rollback, startup lifecycle sync, repeated init, GUI registration, Quick Setup live-host behavior, and UI stack cleanup.
- Updated the test harness to isolate Framework factories and exercise Lib-host discovery paths.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-04-20

Initial public release of the adamant Modpack Framework surface.

### Added

- coordinator discovery and module tab ordering
- shared main-window UI for coordinated modpacks
- Quick Setup, Profiles, and Dev coordinator tabs
- hash/profile export and import flow through the HUD layer
- coordinated module hosting through Lib module hosts
- master pack toggle handling with transactional runtime rollback
- shared theme, HUD, discovery, and UI factory surfaces
